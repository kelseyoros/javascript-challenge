# javascript-challenge

In this challenge, I created a webpage the allows users to filter the table data that holds eye-witness reports of UFOs for specific values.

### Steps:
1. Created a basic HTML web page.
2. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
3. Used a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
